If you have python or not, you should open pythonDownloader.bat. 
Don't close or do anything until you see the text "Press any key to continue . . .". 
Add to PATH in Python setup and select pip feature. After that, you can open either GDLG.py or GDLG NoColorama.py. 
The only difference between them is that there is no text color in the console in NoColorama version and it is only version 1.3.5.

I recommend that you do not open Resources folder in order not to spoil the fun.
